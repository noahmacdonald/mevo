Web-app interface for a predictive model of the US auto market.

After developing a model implementing the Random Forest algorithm (scikit-learn), I built this simple web app interface for the model. Using a Flask backend, the core components of the model implementation in Python are run and results are displayed on the screen. The data is displayed on the left side of the screen (though, no data has been stored in this repo) and each cell is edittable. The changes are reflected in the model when the "Re-Calibrate" button is pressed.
